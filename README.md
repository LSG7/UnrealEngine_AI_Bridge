# Door to isekai Project

***Notice: Just before launch***  
I'm releasing it the Second week of November.  
While I was developing, my Google AdMob app was suspended.  
They blocked my app for clicking on ads.   
This delayed the launch by a month.

## What is this?
- Problem:  
  We need AI to make game world but AI(LLM) doesn't understand unreal project and editor.  
- Solution:  
  'Door to isekai' UnrealEngine Plugin allows AIs(gpt,claude,gemini) to control the Unreal Engine editor.  
  It's the Unreal version of what's known as Vibe Coding.  
  AIs can understand and manipulate unreal project using this tool.
